Sentiment Analysis: What is it?
“The practice of applying 
Natural Language Processing and Text Analysis 
techniques to identify and extract
subjective information from a piece of text”

It determines if an expression is positive, negative, or neutral, and to what degree.



 HOW It works?

Collect Data
Social Media, Blogs, Twitter, News, Product Reviews
Analyze Data
Algorithms process the data and performs sentence splitting
Algorithms scan keywords to categorize a statement as negative or positive based on a simple binary analysis 
Ex: “enjoyed” = good, “miserable” = bad

Indexing
Algorithms tag sentences based on polarity and intensity sentiments
Delivery
Provides an output reporting the outcome of the analysis


What Can it do for Brands?

Increase Customer Retention
Resolve Customer Experience
 Optimize Customer Service
Optimize Pricing Measure Social Media ROI



The sys module provides information about constants, functions and methods of the Python interpreter. 
dir(system) gives a summary of the available constants, functions and methods. 
Another possibility is the help() function. Using help(sys) provides valuable detail information.


Tweepy is an open source Python package that gives you a very convenient way to access the Twitter API with Python.
 Tweepy includes a set of classes and methods that represent Twitter's models and API endpoints,
 and it transparently handles various implementation details, such as: Data encoding and decoding


The csv module gives the Python programmer the ability to parse CSV (Comma Separated Values) files.
 A CSV file is a human readable text file where each line has a number of fields, separated by commas or some other delimiter

A regular expression is a special sequence of characters that helps you match or find other strings or sets of strings,
 using a specialized syntax held in a pattern.
 Regular expressions are widely used in UNIX world. The Python module re provides full support for Perl-like regular expressions in Python.
